# IoT Enabled Irrigation System

An Internet of Things (IoT) based irrigation system designed to automate
water supply for agricultural fields using sensor data and embedded
controllers. The system aims to optimize water usage by monitoring
environmental conditions and controlling irrigation intelligently.

## Project Overview

This project integrates an Arduino microcontroller and an ESP8266 Wi-Fi
module to collect sensor data such as soil moisture, temperature, and
humidity. Based on the sensed parameters, the system controls a water pump
through a relay module.

The system also supports remote monitoring through an IoT platform,
allowing users to observe real-time sensor data and system status.
